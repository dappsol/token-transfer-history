## Solana Token Transaction History Tracker

### Description

This project retrieves the transaction history for a given wallet address and token mint address on the Solana blockchain. It identifies and lists all transactions where the specified token is sent or received by the provided wallet address. The project is built using TypeScript and leverages Solana's blockchain data to provide accurate and up-to-date transaction information.

### Features

- Retrieve transaction history for any Solana wallet address and token mint address.
- Filter transactions to show only those involving the specified token.
- Display detailed information about each transaction, including the sender, receiver, amount, and timestamp.
- Built with TypeScript for strong type checking and improved developer experience.

### Installation
